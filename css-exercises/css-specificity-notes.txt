More specific, more important rule is.
Last rule wins (given equal specificity)

Order of importance:
Inline style (in order) > Internal CSS > External CSS
Tag selectors (lowest specificity)
Classes are more specific than Tags
IDs are more specific than classes (but don't use IDs too often b/c it can't be over-written (except inline styles but also a nightmare to find so stick to classes))
Overwrite anything by typing in '!important' (overrides everything but not recommended or have an AMAZING reason)
Don't use element selectors if you don't have to.
Be generous with use of classes. Keeps level of specificity across the board.
Avoid nexting selectors as much as possible.
